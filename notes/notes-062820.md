# events

You still have to save the events

Can the message table be in cache
Reload into cache

Row editing messages
Control of locking of rows

Why lock the row?
Editing can only happen by the sender

Edit will happen in different rows

---

Capturing requests.

Change log.

Capture snapshot.

Capture range of messages that changed.

Request log vs change log.
- saving the requests
- changes to the object

vs. capture what exactly changed

---

Do we need the API at this point.

1. send requests vs change data information
   - deletes might be harder
   - filtering of the request log

2. event logs for old messages (so you apply events to the 
   previous messages)
   - vs apply all events between two time points

3. snapshoting does it allow deleting of transactions?

facebook doesn't allow messages
messages are not persisted
empty chat window pops up and pagination

skype keeps everything

---

allowing edits and persistent of messages
- keep track of edits
- know the history of messages because there is causality
  legal requirements
- deleting

switchable enterprise vs recreational
- accountability

---

starting off with some basic components which don't require
higher order decisions
- minimal feature

---

pick a design for transactions
pick critical features for end to end flow
diagram of cluster system
sketch components together
- agree on API
- UML for these features
implentation of components
